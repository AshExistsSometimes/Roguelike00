Creating Rooms:
- Build room, include doors to make it accessible
- Give the room prefab the "Room Instance" script
- Add prefabs: DoorAnchors and RoomBounds

	DoorAnchors:
	Place one door anchor on each door
	Ensure the positive Z of each door faces out of the room

	RoomBounds:
	ensure the collider provided encompasses the entire room, this prevents 	overlap
